                <p>Autonomous cars (autocars) are vehicles that can operate without human control and do not require any human intervention. As they are an emerging technology that has yet to be integrated into society, it is important to understand how will the users interact and use this technology. Through our research we have developed an interface that facilitates the use of autocars to help our target users to get home after a night of drinking away from home. By doing so we have come to understand how the users would interact and use autocars as a means to transport intoxicated user home safely and efficiently.</p>

                <p>Before any work can be done, the context and information about autocars must be well understood. Thus, online research was done by reading through research papers that highlight the capabilities of the autocars and how the technology works. After a clear understanding of the autocars is acquired we can shift our attention to how we can use them to benefit society. Some advantages an autocar has over a human driver is that they have faster reaction times and reduced need for insurance, traffic police and visual signage (Bimbraw, 2015). These advantages are very beneficial to intoxicated drivers who have their ability to stay safe or operate a vehicle impaired. As autocars remove the need for users to drive and is efficient in transporting users from A to B, it is a definitely a viable option to transport intoxicated users home safely.</p>
                <p>To gather an adequate amount of user responses in the limited span of only a few weeks, the user research method chosen was to conduct an online survey. The reason was that the online survey can be simply distributed by sending a URL to potential respondents. The survey had the following questions.</p>
                <p><ol>
                  <li>What is your age?</li>
                  <li>Gender</li>
                  <li>How often do you consume alcohol outside of home, at night time?</li>
                  <li>Where do you usually consume alcohol outside of home?</li>
                  <li>Would you consider yourself a heavy drinker?</li>
                  <li>How far do you live away from the venue?</li>
                  <li>What is the main mode of transport do you take to get home after a night of drinking?</li>
                  <li>Do you usually go home alone?</li>
                  <li>How safe would you say it is to get home from the venue?</li>
                  <li>What are some of the things that impact your sense of safety when going home?</li>
                  <li>How long do you usually stay at the venue?</li>
                </ol></p>

                <p>Question 10 was the main question used to understand the user behaviour whilst the other questions were used to construct accurate personae that are representative of the the users. The responses of Question 10 were analysed through an affinity diagram. The main concerns identified which could have an impact on a user’s sense of safety were the following.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The conditions and reputation of the location they are in.</li>
                  <li>Whether or not transport is easily accessible when they leave.</li>
                  <li>The level of intoxication of their peers and themselves.</li>
                  <li>The number of people are accompanying them.</li>
                  <li>Strangers are potentially dangerous people.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Using the findings from the affinity diagram and the personae, storyboards were constructed to paint a clear picture of the scenarios that the users may find themselves in. By doing so, we have found 2 key problems; drink driving and being left stranded away from home. As it is commonly known, drink driving can lead to serious injury or death. Furthermore, alcohol fueled violence is quite a common news topic so it is understandable that users do not wish to be stranded.</p>

                <p>In contemplation, questions 5, and 8 could have been more open ended as their limited scopes had contributed less in the creation of the personae. An alternative question to question 5 could have been “How much do you usually drink?” and as for question 8 “How many people do you usually travel with when you go home?”. These questions would have allowed for personae that were more accurate representations of the users. If by doing so, the subsequent prototypes developed may have accommodated for multiple intoxicated users. Alas, our focus was limited to simply just one user.</p>

              <p>We came up with many ideas to help solve the problems we had found. To name a few, we thought about an in-car interface and a smartwatch which both converged into the concept of having an app that could call for an autocar to take user home. Our second concept was based on the idea that we could prevent the problems from happening. By giving the users more information to make more rational decisions, we could potentially stop users from being exposed to undue risk.</p>

              <p>Our first concept was the Autonomous Taxi App (“the app”) which is based on these 2 key components.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Users can schedule the autocar before heading out.</li>
                <li>Users save their home address and details so that when they need to go home, they can simply push a button.</li>
              </ol>

                <p>The app works by having the users make their decisions while their mind is not affected by alcohol. The app also functions like a regular taxi app, that also allowed users to call for an autocar like any other taxi app would.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Our second concept was the Interactive Breath Test (IBT) which was designed to be placed near the exit of a bar. This is essentially a large touchscreen terminal, with a breathalyzer on the side. It works by finding the level of intoxication of the user, and from there it recommends to the user the best course of action to get home safely. There are 3 possible results.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>High BAC - Recommend to the user to call for an autocar.</li>
                  <li>Moderate BAC - Recommend to the user to either take public transport or call for an autocar.</li>
                  <li>Low or negligible BAC - No recommendation, tell the user that they can safely drive home.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Breathalyzers usually require users to blow through a tube thus raising a hygiene issue however, we imagined it to be a simple sensor with does not require physical contact. </p>

                <p>We created paper prototypes for each concept and iterated according to feedback from our test participants. Our participants were selected randomly, and were given the context and were asked to complete a task with the paper prototype. Each participant was recorded while being evaluated with the following methods</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Contextual Observation - We took note of the participant’s movements such as facial expression and gestures. The data collected helped us to understand how a user would feel when using the prototype.</li>
                  <li>Think Aloud Protocol - As they are completing the task, we are able to understand the thought processes of the participant, and it helped to identify roadblocks.</li>
                  <li>Questionnaire - The questions asked elaborated on the data gathered from the contextual observation and Think Aloud Protocol. This allowed us to have a better insight of the participant’s perspective when they are using our prototypes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The first few prototypes had many inconsistencies such as some screens having no navigation bar, and different sized and shaped buttons. Other issues include missing steps, and confusing elements. As we iterated upon each paper prototype we managed to remove many of these problems.</p>

                <p>As we tested the app, we noticed that it had familiar design patterns that were present in the other apps in the current market. Such as having a hideaway menu with the 3 horizontal bar icons and the 5 star rating system at the end. One of the main features was the car selection screen which allowed for 3 autocar options with different arrival times. The problem with this screen was that it did not provide any justification as to why a user would want to choose a car that arrived later as opposed to earlier or vice versa. Some participants even argued that they would like to spend more time while scheduling a later pickup. We iterated upon this by adding more information like the company name or brand of the autocar, the cost and how many people it can transport. Upon further testing, we have found that the company name or brand of the autocar was inconsequential to the users. Therefore, as suggested by one of the participants, we replaced these labels with; Economy, Spacious, and Luxury. These new labels are less ambiguous as they tell the user what type of vehicle they are ordering. As opposed to choosing a brand and hoping the vehicle they ordered is what they want.</p>
                <p>As for the IBT, we found that the small buttons placed at inconsistent locations of the screen. According to the feedback, these problems would likely confuse an intoxicated user. We implemented a logical progression layout similar to that of a book. The layout works by having the user progress by pressing the arrow on the right and to backtrack they press the arrow on the left. The advantage of this layout is that the user would have some spatial awareness as well as the simple page by page progression. As a result of implementing this layout the user would not get lost as they can simply move forward and backwards by pressing the arrows. One disadvantage found was that users would feel they had very little control over where they are in the prototype. Thus a quit button was placed on the upper left corner to allow users to abort the process if they needed to.</p>
                <p>Additionally, one participant noted that the small buttons of the IBT were hard to press if they were intoxicated. To compensate for the lack of fine motor control, we enlarged to buttons. A few participants found that the sheer volume of text was difficult to comprehend if they were intoxicated, so the messages were limited to a maximum of 1 or 2 sentences per screen, and much of the communication is done visually using colours and simple icons. As an example, one piece of information that could be misunderstand was the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) value. If the user does not know the context of this number given, they would not understand the severity of their intoxication, thus we used red, yellow and green circles to better communicate this. These coloured circles referenced traffic lights which not only was appropriate to the theme of the prototype, the colour theory behind them were familiar enough to the users that they would easily understand what is communicated (Green often means no issues, and red signifies danger).</p>

                <p>While the app certainly would perform its function, however there were already other apps in the market which more or less performed the same function, like UBER for example. Should the app be developed further, and released into the public, it would be competing with these already existing apps. Furthermore, the app’s focus is very broad and does not specialise in aiding intoxicated users to get home safely. Therefore any more development to make it specialise in aiding intoxicated users would simply limit its functionality to a degree that it would be less useful than the existing apps in the current market. This would mean the app would be a far less viable tool to the user. Whereas the IBT focuses solely on getting intoxicated users home safely, with such a specialised focus, the development potential is much greater than the app. By comparing the ability to develop each concept further, it was clear to us that the IBT was the correct decision.</p>

                <p>While building our final prototype the platforms we chose were Figma to make the screens and Atomic.io for animation. The reason being that they can be used on the Windows computers we use. In contemplation, these platforms are relatively new and had limited features compared to more established platforms such as Sketch and Framer. Atomic.io was frustrating to use as it was poorly documented, and the online guides were out of date. Some finer detailed animations we wished to include could not be implemented. So instead, we had to discover some workarounds to overcome the limitations of the platforms used. In the end our prototype had simple animations which were only passable. The lesson learned here was that we should always choose more robust and established platforms to ensure a higher fidelity prototype.</p>

              <p>In our final prototype we implemented the following visual design features.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Dark Background - A bar usually would have subdued lighting, so a white background was not appropriate as the glare it produces would hurt the user’s eyes.</li>
                <li>Orange Colour - In terms of colour theory, this colour was an indication of happiness and warmth. It makes the interface feel welcoming.</li>
                <li>White Text - The high contrast makes it easy to read.</li>
                <li>Sans-serif font - It gives the interface a casual and friendly feel.</li>
                <li>Serif font titles - It gives a clearer distinction between titles and reading text.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Overall these visual design changes would make the users feel welcome with its feel and improve intoxicated user comprehension with its easily distinguishable visuals.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Further iterating upon the implemented features, we also noticed that the written text sounded very uncaring which may come off as hostile to the users. This would mean that the interface could potentially offend the users and be less likely to use the IBT in the future. So the sentences were rewritten to communicate in a casual yet polite and professional manner. Additionally, to improve the experience of navigating through the screens, a simple circle navbar which shows the user how much they have progressed through the IBT. Some of the arrows disappear to prevent the user from skipping through the IBT without completing the steps required to call an autocar. With these changes, the interface is far more resilient to errors, and would feel more friendly to the user.</p>

                <p>Over the course of a few months we have successfully designed an interface that encourages users to make better transport decisions to get home. The streamlined experience, the simple visuals and language work together to ensure that even while intoxicated, the user is still able to use it. In contemplation, future developments to the IBT may include having an emergency feature that can send users who are passed out to the hospital or clinic, or perhaps facilitate multiple passengers wishing to travel together which would perhaps increase the safety of the intoxicated user. However, in its current state, the IBT with all the features it has, we are confident that it will minimise if not prevent drink driving and being stranded away from home. By doing so, the IBT will succeed in aiding users to safer and more efficient transport options, and is an example of an interface that takes advantage of the emerging technology of the autocar.</p>
